# Matrix - Rearrange Alphabets & Integers
# The program must accept a matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The matrix contains K*K alphabets and the rest are integers. The program must rearrange the matrix so that all K*K alphabets must be present at the bottom-right K*K submatrix. The integers and alphabets must be arranged in the order of their occurrence. Then the program must print the revised matrix as the output.
# Note: The value of K is always less than or equal to both R and C.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 2 <= R, C <= 50
# 1 <= Value of each integer in the matrix <= 10^5

# Input Format:
# The first line contains R, C and K separated by a space.
# The next R lines contain the matrix.

# Output Format:
# The first R lines contain the revised matrix.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 5 5 3
# 90 b 86 76 i
# a 14 c 99 12
# 91 d 64 54 e
# 82 78 51 f 67
# h 43 g 56 65

# Output:
# 90 86 76 14 99
# 12 91 64 54 82
# 78 51 b i a
# 67 43 c d e
# 56 65 f h g

# Explanation:
# Here K = 3, so there are 9 alphabets in the matrix.
# b i a c d e f h g

# The remaining integers are given below.
# 90 86 76 14 99 12 91 64 54 82 78 51 67 43 56 65

# After rearranging the alphabets and integers based on the given conditions, the matrix becomes
# 90 86 76 14 99
# 12 91 64 54 82
# 78 51 b i a
# 67 43 c d e
# 56 65 f h g

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 6 4 2
# A B 49 42
# 97 59 95 17
# D C 44 25
# 24 37 26 19
# 76 78 91 86
# 54 60 81 61

# Output:
# 49 42 97 59
# 95 17 44 25
# 24 37 26 19
# 76 78 91 86
# 54 60 A B
# 81 61 D C

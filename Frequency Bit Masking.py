# Frequency Bit Masking
# The program must accept a string S containing only lower case alphabets as the input. The program must generate integer values based on the following conditions.
# - The binary representation of the first integer indicates the presence of first occurrence of alphabets in S.
# - The binary representation of the second integer indicates the presence of second occurrence of alphabets in S.
# - The binary representation of the third integer indicates the presence of third occurrence of alphabets in S.
# - Similarly, the program must generate the integer values for the remaining alphabets.
# In each integer value, the 26-bits from LSB(least significant bit) to MSB(most significant bit) are mapped to the 26 lower case alphabets(a-z).
# - Each 1 in the binary representation indicates the presence of the corresponding lower case alphabet.
# - Each 0 in the binary representation indicates the absence of the corresponding lower case alphabet.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= Length of S <= 100

# Input Format:
# The first line contains S.

# Output Format:
# The lines, each contains an integer value as per the given conditions.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# abcacbca

# Output:
# 7
# 7
# 5

# Explanation:
# The alphabet a occurs thrice.
# The alphabet b occurs twice.
# The alphabet c occurs thrice.
# 1st integer: 7 -> 111 (It indicates the presence first occurrence of c b and a).
# 2nd integer: 7 -> 111 (It indicates the presence second occurrence of c b and a).
# 3rd integer: 5 -> 101 (It indicates the presence third occurrence of c and a).

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# skillrack

# Output:
# 396549
# 3072

# Tilted Rectangle Pattern
# The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the tilted rectangle pattern of N lines based on the following conditions.
# - In the 1st line, the program must print N-1 hyphens and N asterisks.
# - In the 2nd line, the program must print N-2 hyphens, an asterisk, N-2 hyphens and an asterisk.
# - In the 3rd line, the program must print N-3 hyphens, an asterisk, N-2 hyphens and an asterisk.
# - Similarly, the first N-1 lines are printed.
# - In the Nth line, the program must print N asterisks.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 100

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.

# Output Format:
# The first N lines contain the pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output Section.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 4

# Output:
# ---****
# --*--*
# -*--*
# ****

# Explanation:
# Here N = 4, so the pattern contains 4 lines of output.
# 1st line: 3 hyphens and 4 asterisks.
# 2nd line: 2 hyphens, an asterisk, 4/2 hyphens and an asterisk.
# 3rd line: 1 hyphen, an asterisk, 4/2 hyphens and an asterisk.
# 4th line: 4 asterisks.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 3

# Output:
# --***
# -*-*
# ***

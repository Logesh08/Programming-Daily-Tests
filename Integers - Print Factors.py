# Integers - Print Factors
# An integer array of N integers is passed as the input. Another integer value K is also passed as the input. The program must consider every K integers and form a new integer X with the unit digits of the K integers considered and print the factors for X.

# Note: If the unit digits of all K integers under consideration is zero, then print 0.

# Hint: Optimize your logic to avoid Time Limit Exceeded Error.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 100
# 1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
# 1 <= K <= 8

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N and K separated by a space.
# The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

# Output Format:
# The first N/K lines contain the factors separated by a space.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 7 3
# 10 20 30 41 50 60 90

# Output:
# 0
# 1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 100

# Explanation:
# Here K=3. The first three integers are 10 20 30. The integer formed with the unit digits is 000 which is equal to 0. Hence 0 is printed.
# The next three integers are 41 50 60. The integer formed with the unit digits is 100. The factors of 100 are 1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 100.
# The seventh value 90 is not considered as we need a set of K=3 integers.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 12 4
# 20 81 20 86 61 20 22 54 10 120 21 73

# Output:
# 1 2 53 106
# 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
# 1 13

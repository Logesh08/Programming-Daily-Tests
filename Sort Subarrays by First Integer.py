# Sort Subarrays by First Integer
# The program must accept an array of N unique integers and an integer K as the input. The value of N is always divisible by K. The program must split the given array into N/K subarrays of equal size K. Then the program must sort the subarrays based on the first integer. Finally, the program must print the revised array as the output.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= K <= N <= 1000
# 1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.
# The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
# The third line contains K.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains the revised N integers separated by a space.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 9
# 30 38 33 50 55 59 10 15 12
# 3

# Output:
# 10 15 12 30 38 33 50 55 59

# Explanation:
# Here N = 9 and K = 3.
# 1st subarray: 30 38 33
# 2nd subarray: 50 55 59
# 3rd subarray: 10 15 12
# After sorting the 3 subarrays based on the first integer, the array becomes
# 10 15 12 30 38 33 50 55 59

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 8
# 3 4 7 6 2 9 5 1
# 2

# Output:
# 2 9 3 4 5 1 7 6

# Explanation:
# Here N = 8 and K = 2.
# 1st subarray: 3 4
# 2nd subarray: 7 6
# 3rd subarray: 2 9
# 4th subarray: 5 1
# After sorting the 4 subarrays based on the first integer, the array becomes
# 2 9 3 4 5 1 7 6

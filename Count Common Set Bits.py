# Count Common Set Bits
# The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the number of set bits that occur in the same positions from LSB(Least Significant Bit) of the given N integers as the output.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 100
# 1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.
# The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains an integer representing the number of set bits that occur in the same positions from LSB.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 4
# 11 75 57 59

# Output:
# 2

# Explanation:
# 11 -> 0001011
# 75 -> 1001011
# 57 -> 0111001
# 59 -> 0111011
# 1st bit from LSB of all 4 integers are equal to 1.
# 4th bit from LSB of all 4 integers are equal to 1.
# So 2 printed as the output.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 5
# 486 495 299 431 511

# Output:
# 3

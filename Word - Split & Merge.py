# Word - Split & Merge
# The program must accept a string S and an integer K as the input. The string S contains multiple words. The integer K represents the position of a word in the string. The program must modify the Kth word in S based on the following conditions.
# - The program must split the Kth word into two equal halves. If the word length is odd, then consider the middle character for both halves.
# - Then the program must reverse the first half and then merge the second half and first half into a single word.
# - Then the program must replace the Kth word with the obtained word in the string S.
# Finally, the program must print the revised string S.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= Length of S <= 1000
# 1 <= K <= Number of words in S.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains S.
# The second line contains K.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains the revised string S.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# This is the right choice
# 4

# Output:
# This is the ghtgir choice

# Explanation:
# Here K = 4.
# The 4th word is right, whose length is odd.
# First Half: rig
# Second Half: ght
# After reversing the first half, rig becomes gir.
# After merging the second half and first half, the word becomes ghtgir.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# This is the right choice
# 1

# Output:
# ishT is the right choice

# Explanation:
# Here K = 1.
# The 1st word is This, whose length is even.
# First Half: Th
# Second Half: is
# After reversing the first half, Th becomes hT.
# After merging the second half and first half, the word becomes ishT.

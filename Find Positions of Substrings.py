# Find Positions of Substrings
# The program must accept a string S and its substrings as the input. All the substrings of S have an equal length. For each substring, the program must print the substring position in the string S as the output.

# Note: All the substrings of S are always unique.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= Length of S <= 100

# Input Format:
# The first line contains S.
# The lines contain the substrings of S.

# Output Format:
# The lines contain the positions of the substrings in S.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# skillrack
# ack
# ski
# llr

# Output:
# 3
# 1
# 2

# Explanation:
# Here S = "skillrack" and its substrings are given below.
# ack -> 3rd substring of S.
# ski -> 1st substring of S.
# llr -> 2nd substring of S.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# donkeymonkeykangaroo
# ymonk
# eykan
# donke
# garoo

# Output:
# 2
# 3
# 1
# 4

# Explanation:
# Here S = "donkeymonkeykangaroo" and its substrings are given below.
# ymonk -> 2nd substring of S.
# eykan -> 3rd substring of S.
# donke -> 1st substring of S.
# garoo -> 4th substring of S.





s = input().strip()
while(True):
    try:
        a = input().strip()
        print((s.index(a) // len(a)) + 1)

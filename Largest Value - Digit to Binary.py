# Largest Value - Digit to Binary
# The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the largest integer that can be formed by replacing a digit with its binary representation in the integer N.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 10^8

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains an integer value representing the largest integer that can be formed by replacing a digit with its binary representation in the integer N.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 392

# Output:
# 310012

# Explanation:
# Here N = 392.
# The three possible integer values are given below.
# 1192 (3 -> 11)
# 310012 (9 -> 1001)
# 3910 (2 -> 10)
# Hence the largest integer 310012 is printed as the output.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 4765

# Output:
# 476101

# Integer - Last Set Bit
# The program must accept N integers as the input. For each integer X among the N integers, the program must find the last occurrence of 1 in the binary representation of X. Then the program must find the corresponding power of 2 value for that last occurrence of 1. Finally, the program must print the sum S of those powers of 2 as the output.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 100
# 1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.
# The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains S.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 5
# 12 10 8 15 22

# Output:
# 17

# Explanation:
# 12 -> 1100 -> 4
# 10 -> 1010 -> 2
# 8 -> 1000 -> 8
# 15 -> 1111 -> 1
# 22 -> 10110 -> 2
# 4 + 2 + 8 + 1 + 2 = 17

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 4
# 100 64 55 72

# Output:
# 77

# Explanation:
# 100 -> 1100100 -> 4
# 64 -> 1000000 -> 64
# 55 -> 110111 -> 1
# 72 -> 1001000 -> 8
# 4 + 64 + 1 + 8 = 77

# Square Submatrix - All Odd/Even
# An integer matrix of size R*C is passed as the input. Another integer N which is a perfect square is also passed as the input. The program must print Yes if there is a submatrix of size SQRT(N)*SQRT(N) with N integers where all the integers are odd or even. Else the program must print No as the output.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= R, C <= 100
# 1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000
# 1 <= SQRT(N) <= 10

# Input Format:
# The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
# The next R lines contain C values each separated by a space.
# The R+2nd line contains N.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains Yes or No.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 5 6
# 1 2 2 2 3 5
# 5 4 4 8 11 9
# 7 12 2 66 8 4
# 9 7 9 8 9 13
# 1 1 1 3 2 5
# 9

# Output:
# Yes

# Explanation:
# N=9 which means the submatrix must be of size 3*3.
# The below submatrix has all the integer values as even. Hence Yes is printed as the output.
# 2 2 2
# 4 4 8
# 12 2 66

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 5 6
# 1 2 2 2 3 5
# 5 4 4 8 11 9
# 7 12 2 66 8 4
# 9 7 9 8 9 13
# 1 1 1 3 2 5
# 16

# Output:
# No

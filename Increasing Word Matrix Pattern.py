# Increasing Word Matrix Pattern
# The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must form a word matrix of size N*N based on the following conditions.
# - In the 1st row, the N words must be formed using consecutive lower case alphabets of lengths 1, 2, 3, ... N.
# - In the 2nd row, the N words must be formed using consecutive lower case alphabets of lengths 2, 3, 4, ... N+1.
# - In the 3rd row, the N words must be formed using consecutive lower case alphabets of lengths 3, 4, 5, ... N+2.
# - Similarly, the words in the remaining rows must be formed.
# - Consider the English alphabet set in circular fashion when creating the words of length more than 26.
# Finally, the program must print the N*N word matrix as the output.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 2 <= N <= 25

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.

# Output Format:
# The first N lines, each contains N words separated by a space.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 4

# Output:
# a ab abc abcd
# ab abc abcd abcde
# abc abcd abcde abcdef
# abcd abcde abcdef abcdefg

# Explanation:
# The length of each word in the 4*4 word matrix is given below.
# 1 2 3 4
# 2 3 4 5
# 3 4 5 6
# 4 5 6 7

# So the 4*4 word matrix is formed using the consecutive lower case alphabets as given below.
# a ab abc abcd
# ab abc abcd abcde
# abc abcd abcde abcdef
# abcd abcde abcdef abcdefg

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 5

# Output:
# a ab abc abcd abcde
# ab abc abcd abcde abcdef
# abc abcd abcde abcdef abcdefg
# abcd abcde abcdef abcdefg abcdefgh
# abcde abcdef abcdefg abcdefgh abcdefghi

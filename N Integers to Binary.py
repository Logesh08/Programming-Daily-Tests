# N Integers to Binary
# The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must form an integer K whose binary representation is formed by choosing Xth bit from the LSB(Least Significant Bit) of Xth integer among the N integers, where X represents the position of the integer. Then the program must print the integer K as the output.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 50
# 1 <= Each integer value <= 10^18

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.
# The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains K.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 5
# 6 10 15 2 16

# Output:
# 22

# Explanation:
# Here N = 5.
# 1st integer: 6 -> 00110 -> 0.
# 2nd integer: 10 -> 01010 -> 1.
# 3rd integer: 15 -> 01111 -> 1.
# 4th integer: 2 -> 00010 -> 0.
# 5th integer: 16 -> 10000 -> 1.
# K = 10110 -> 22.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 3
# 7 4 12

# Output:
# 5

# Match Name and Designation - Employees
# The program must accept two string values F1 and F2 representing the names of two text files as the input. The file F1 contains the id and name of N employees and the file F2 contains the id and designation of the N employees.

# Note:
# - Both files are always in the same folder where the program executes.

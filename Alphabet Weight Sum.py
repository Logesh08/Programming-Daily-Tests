# Alphabet Weight Sum
# The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. Each alphabet(ignoring case) has a weight as given below.
# A = 0
# B = 1
# C = Weight of A + Weight of B
# D = Weight of B + Weight of C
# and so on.
# The program must print the total weight of the alphabets in the given string S as the output.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= Length of S <= 100

# Input Format:
# The first line contains S.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains an integer value representing the total weight of the alphabets.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# Bat

# Output:
# 4182

# Explanation:
# Here S = "Bat".
# B = 1
# a = 0
# t = 4181
# So their sum is 4182 (1 + 0 + 4181).

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# SkillRack

# Output:
# 4491

# Explanation:
# Here S = "SkillRack".
# S = 2584
# k = 55
# i = 21
# l = 89
# l = 89
# R = 1597
# a = 0
# c = 1
# k = 55
# So their sum is 4491 (2584 + 55 + 21 + 89 + 89 + 1597 + 0 + 1 + 55).
